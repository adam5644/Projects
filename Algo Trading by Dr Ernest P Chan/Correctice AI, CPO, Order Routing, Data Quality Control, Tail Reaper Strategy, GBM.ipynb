    "# How to use meta-labelling\n",
    "- A separate primary model (e.g. supervised ML, features may be some technical indicators or other statistical insights) to decide whether to long, short or do nothing at this time period\n",
    "- Meta-labelling as secondary model to decide trade size of each buy/sell suggested by the primary model. Meta-labelling is supervised ML, where outcome of triple barrier method are used as dependent variable. Dependent variable may include macro or financial data. \n",
    "    - \"Triple barrier method\" is used to create the labels to be feed into a meta-labelling model. Triple barrier method sets 3 barriers (take profit, stop loss and time horizon).Secondary model use the 3 barriers to determine trade's potential and adjust size accordingly. Primary model label a point as 1 (buy) or 0 (sell), while secondary model label each point as 1 (take profit), 0 (time horizon exceeded) and -1 (stop loss), then create a \"meta-labelling\" model to interpret the labels of the triple barrier method \n",
    "        - (e.g.) secondary model suggest expected return is high and risk is low, then trade size is large\n",
    "- the challenge is in the time complexity in implementing meta-labelling: \n",
    "    - setting barriers based on historical data analysis, training on high frequency data\n",
    "### Why use meta-labelling?\n",
    "- (1) Meta labeling allows you to build an ML system on top of a white box (like a fundamental model founded on economic theory). This ability to transform a fundamental model into an ML model should make meta labeling particularly useful to “quantamental” firms. \n",
    "- (2) effects of overfitting are limited when you apply meta labeling, because ML will not decide the side of your bet, only the size\n",
    "- (3) by decoupling the side prediction from the size prediction, meta labeling enables sophisticated strategy structures. For instance, consider that the features driving a rally may differ from the features driving a sell-off. In that case, you may want to develop an ML strategy exclusively for long positions, based on the buy recommendations of a primary model, and an ML strategy exclusively for short positions, based on the sell recommendations of an entirely different primary model.\n",
    "- (4) achieving high accuracy on small bets and low accuracy on large bets will ruin you. As important as identifying good opportunities is to size them properly, so it makes sense to develop an ML algorithm solely focused on getting that critical decision (sizing) right. Meta labeling ML models can deliver more robust and reliable outcomes than standard labeling models."

    "- In Spectral PCA, the term 'spectral' refers to the use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors (spectra) of matrices associated with the data, such as the Laplacian matrix in the case of graph data. Spectral PCA can be particularly useful for data that lie on a non-linear manifold, which traditional PCA might not handle well since PCA assumes linear relationships among variables.\n",
    "- For example, Spectral PCA might be used in the analysis of graph data, where the nodes represent instances and the edges represent some form of similarity or connection. \n",
    "- In machine learning, Spectral PCA could be used to identify the underlying structure in complex datasets and is related to other spectral methods like **spectral clustering**, which uses similar principles to group data points that are connected or similar according to the structure of the data graph."

    "- Fast Execution Systems: If the execution system is extremely fast and efficient, it can take advantage of price improvements that occur in the milliseconds between when an order is placed and when it is executed.\n",
    "- Liquidity and Market Conditions: In highly liquid markets, prices can change very quickly. If the market moves in your favor in the brief moment between placing an order and its execution, this can result in negative slippage.\n",
    "- Limit Orders and Gaps: Limit orders can also lead to negative slippage. For example, if a stock closes at $10, you place a limit order to buy at $10.05, but due to overnight news, the stock opens at $9.95 the next day, your order may be filled at $9.95, which is better than your specified limit.\n",

    "# Heterogeneous portfolios \n",
    "- a portfolio that consist of a diverse range of financial instruments. These portfolios can include various types of assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, etc., each behaving differently under market conditions\n",
    "- Signals are described as heterogeneous because they vary in nature; some might predict short-term price movements (over hours or days), while others might be based on long-term macroeconomic forecasts (spanning years). \n",
    "- It is difficult in optimally combining (\"mixing\") these diverse signals into a single, coherent investment strategy, especially when considering transaction costs (the costs associated with buying and selling assets).\n",
    "- An attempt to tackle this issue may be through **mean-field approximations** and **numerical exploration**. Mean-field approximation is a technique used in physics and economics to simplify complex systems by considering the average effect of all components (in this case, signals) on any single component. The goal is to develop an intuition for the optimal mixing policy in simplified, stylized scenarios, potentially using a toy model. A **toy model** is a simplified, often abstract model used to understand the workings of complex systems. It helps provide insights into what might happen in more realistic situations. The ultimate objective is to gain a better understanding of how to optimally mix diverse trading signals in the presence of transaction costs, thereby contributing to the field of econophysics and complex systems as applied to financial markets."

    "# Order routing\n",
    "- Order routing is a real-time decision-making process that determines where to send a trade order to achieve the best possible execution. It deals with live market data and requires high-speed algorithms and connectivity to multiple trading venues.\n",
    "- the process by which an order from an investor or trader is placed and subsequently executed in the market. It involves determining the best possible venue for a trade and the path the order will take to reach that venue. The goal is to obtain the best possible execution for the order, which often means the best available price, but can also include other factors such as speed, the likelihood of execution, and the size of the order\n",
    "### considerations\n",
    "- Best Execution: Regulations in many markets require brokers to achieve the best execution for their clients' orders. This doesn't always mean the lowest price for buys or the highest price for sells; it also considers factors like the speed of execution, the size of the spread, and the likelihood of the order being filled.\n",
    "- Multiple Venues: Modern financial markets are fragmented across many different exchanges and alternative trading systems, each with its own supply and demand dynamics. An order routing system must consider all these venues to find the best possible execution.\n",
    "- Price Aggregation: Order routing often involves aggregating prices from different exchanges. This means the system will compare prices across different venues and route the order to the one that offers the best terms according to the instructions provided by the trader and the broker's best execution policy.\n",
    "- Speed: In markets where prices can change rapidly, the speed of order routing is crucial. High-frequency trading (HFT) firms, for example, use sophisticated technology to route orders and execute trades within microseconds to take advantage of price discrepancies across venues.\n",
    "- Smart Order Routing (SOR): Many brokers use Smart Order Routing systems that automatically select the best trading venue. SORs use algorithms to make real-time decisions about where to route orders to optimize for execution quality, considering current market conditions and the specific attributes of the order.\n",
    "- Order Types: Different types of orders (market, limit, stop-loss, etc.) have different routing strategies. For example, a market order may be routed to the venue with the best current price, while a limit order may be placed on the venue where it is most likely to be executed at the desired price.\n",
    "- Arbitrage: Order routing can also be part of arbitrage strategies where a trader or algorithm seeks to profit from price discrepancies for the same asset across different markets.\n",
    "- The efficiency gained from linking mutiple databases can indirectly benefit order routing by ensuring that the strategies that inform routing decisions are based on comprehensive and reliable historical data."

    "# Tail reaper strategy\n",

Tail events are those that lie outside the normal distribution of returns, representing rare but significant jumps or drops in asset prices. These events can be driven by significant geopolitical events, economic announcements, sudden market shifts, or any unexpected news that can cause a rapid and substantial change in asset value.\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "- Identifying Tail Events: This involves statistical analysis to identify potential tail events. Quantitative models might analyze historical data to find patterns or conditions that precede such events.\n",
    "- Positioning: The strategy typically involves taking long positions in assets or derivatives that are expected to increase in value during extreme market movements. For example, buying out-of-the-money options which may have a low cost but can become highly valuable if a significant market move occurs.\n",
    "- Risk Management: Given the rarity of tail events, a significant challenge of the Tail Reaper strategy is managing the cost of maintaining positions against the potential payoff. Effective risk management techniques are crucial to ensure that the strategy remains viable over time, as many positions may expire worthless if the anticipated event does not occur.\n",
    "- Leverage and Derivatives: The use of leverage and derivatives is common in Tail Reaper strategies to amplify returns from correctly anticipated tail events. However, this also increases the risk, making risk management even more critical.\n",
    "- One of the main challenges is the cost associated with maintaining positions that may frequently expire worthless, balanced against the significant gains when a tail event does occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Other Strategies\n",
    "- Tail Risk Hedging: Unlike tail risk hedging, which aims to protect a portfolio from tail events, the Tail Reaper strategy actively seeks to profit from them.\n",
